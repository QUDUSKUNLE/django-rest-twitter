### REST API
This application posts tweets to your timeline and retrieve tweets from your timeline

### The Approach
- I created a userprofile model which inherits from the django AbstractBaseUser to store a user's info and its authorization keys
- I created an endpoints to login a user which will return a token. The token is used to verify a user when requests are made
- I created endpoints for getting and retriving tweets
- I handled errors when a user has not supplied his auth keys in the django admin
- I handled errors when user is not logged in and try to get or post tweets
- I handled errors when the auth keys are wrong
- I handled errors when user try to post an empty tweets
